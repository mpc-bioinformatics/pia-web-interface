step_psms_fdr_help=In this step the PSM FDR is calculated. After the \
	calculation, it is possible to discard identifications which are below a \
	certain quality threshold.<br/>\
	Below you can choose to either give the same settings for FDR calculation \
	to all imported files, or give the settings for each file separately.

create_psm_sets_help=This option lets you choose, if identifications from \
	different search engines for the same spectrum should be combined. For \
	this, PSMs from all input files with the same properties are combined \
	into PSM sets.<br/>\
	If you want to combine the results from different LC-MS/MS runs, this \
	option should be turned of. Whereas, if you are combining the results from \
	more than one search engine run of the same LC-MS/MS run, this option \
	should be enabled.

fdr_thr_help=The selected FDR threshold, below which a PSM is assigned as \
	good. This is used during the whole workflow, i.e. the PSMs which are not \
	below the threshold will be discarded during the peptide and protein \
	inference.

decoy_strategy_help=Some search engines allow you to perform a decoy search \
	without a specific decoy database. The identified decoys are usually \
	stored in the result file of the search engine, though sometimes not shown \
	to the user. PIA usually finds these decoys and adds them to the PSM pool. \
	If no such decoys were found, you see a note behind the option.<br/> \
	If you performed a classical search with a target-decoy-database and your \
	decoys are distinguishable by a prefix or suffix, use "accession \
	pattern".<br/> \
	If you selected a decoy search while running the search engine, select "by \
	searchengine".

decoy_pattern_help=The pattern to distinguish the decoys from the target \
	identifications. You may use normal regular expression.<br/>\
	Usually the decoys are labeled by a prefix, so you can use something like \
	"decoy_.*", or a suffix, for which you would use ".*_decoy".

top_identifications_help=After the identification it is often common to use \
	the top identification of the spectra only. Here you can select to discard \
	all other identifications except the best of each spectrum, or to use all \
	available identifications.

preferred_fdr_scores_help=Here you can select and order the preferred PSM \
	scores used for the FDR calculation.<br/>\
	If no score is selected, PIA will choose the first best score in each \
	file, which may not be desired.

selected_fdr_scores_help=Here you can select the PSM score, which should be \
	used for the FDR calculation.

step_psms_review_help=In this step you can review the PSM data and calculated \
	FDR levels.

all_psms_help=This is the number of all PSMs or PSM sets in the file, \
	regardless of their FDR.

fdr_items_help=The number of PSMs (respective PSM sets) with a valid FDR value \
	comprises the PSMs, which are within the range of the top identifications \
	selected for the FDR calculation. The PSMs not in these top \
	identifications will get an NaN value for FDR value.

fdr_targets_help=The number of PSMs (respective PSM sets) with a valid FDR \
	value and assigned as a target, i.e. not decoy, according to the used \
	decoy selection strategy.

fdr_decoys_help=The number of PSMs (respective PSM sets) with a valid FDR \
	value and assigned as a decoy, according to the used decoy selection \
	strategy.

fdr_good_help=This is the number of targets/decoys below the given FDR \
	threshold. These identifications are considered to be of good quality.

fdr_ppm_help=The chart shows the distribution of the PPM divergence. If the \
	FDR is calculated, only the targets below the FDR threshold are taken into \
	account, else all PSM (sets) are counted. The data show either 99.5% of \
	all possible PSMs or -10 - 10 PPM.

fdr_identifications_help=This chart displays, how many PSM sets have how many \
	identifications from different search engine runs. If the FDR is \
	calculated, only the targets below the FDR threshold are taken into account.

consider_modifications_help=If the modifications should be considered for the \
	inference of peptides, a PSM must have the same sequence and the same \
	modifications to be counted for the same peptide. If not, only the \
	sequence is considered for creating peptides.

step_peptides_help=In this step you can review the peptide identifications. \
	The peptides are inferred from the PSMs by combining all PSMs with the \
	same amino acid sequence. If the modifications should also be considered, \
	also all modifications of the PSMs must be equal, to be the same peptide.

all_peptides_help=This is the number of all possible peptides of the given \
	file. For the calculation, the FDR is not taken into account.

fdr_good_peptides_help=This is the number of peptides which are identified by \
	at least one PSM (set) with an FDR below the given threshold.

peptide_identifications_help=This chart displays, how many peptides are \
	identified by how many PSMs / PSM sets. If the FDR is calculated, only \
	the peptides which have at least one PSM with an FDR below the given \
	threshold are taken into account.

step_protein_inference_help=Here you can make the basic settings for the \
	protein inference.

inference_method_help=The inference method is the main algorithm of the \
	inference. Usually you can leave the selected value, but for experimenting \
	it is ok to play around with this setting.

inference_score_help=The main score used for the protein inference. If you \
	calculated the Combined FDR Score, you should use this. If not, the FDR \
	Score is recommended. Least recommended, but good for a quick survey, is \
	the usage of a search engines "raw" score. 

step_review_proteins_help=In this last step you can review the inferred \
	proteins. For a more thorough overview and more protein inference \
	settings, it is highly recommended to switch to the "Protein View" of the \
	Advanced mode.


pia_inference_tree=This tree demonstrates the spectra (lightblue), peptides \
	(orange), groups (blue) and accessions (green) used by PIA. <br/> \
	Depending on how the visualization was called, different nodes are filled \
	or grayed out. If a single PSM or peptide was called, only this one is \
	filled, for a PSM set all used identified spectra are filled. <br/> \
	If a protein group was called, all used accessions, peptides and spectra \
	of this protein group are filled, while the ones used by any other protein \
	group are colored, but not filled. Grayed out nodes are used for PSMs, \
	peptides and accessions, which were not reported after protein \
	inference.<br/> \
	Clicking on an edge highlights it. Clicking on a node, highlights the \
	outgoing edges, while double clicking highlights the incoming edges.
